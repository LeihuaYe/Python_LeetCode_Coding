# Python_LeetCode_Coding

There are four coding components in Data Science Interviews: Data Structure & Algorithm, Machine Learning Algorithms, Math & Statistics, and Data (String) manipulation. 

I live-code real interview questions asked by major tech companies in this repository and host the Python code here. On each topic, there is a detailed technical blog post available on my Data Science blog: https://leihua-ye.medium.com.  

To maximize the utility of this repo, I'd suggest combining both materials and practice at your own pace.
