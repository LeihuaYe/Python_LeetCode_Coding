# Python_LeetCode_Coding

For the coding part in any Data Science Interviews, there are mainly four components: Data Structure & Algorithm, Machine Learning Algorithms, Math and Statistics, and Data Manipulation. In this repository, I will host real interview questions asked by major tech companies and their Python solutions. On each topic, I will write a technical post on my Medium blog (https://medium.com/@leihua_ye). 

## Part 1: Math and Statistics:

## Installing
We need to two packages: numpy and matplotlib.pyplot.
